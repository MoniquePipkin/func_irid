Breast and belly green, shading to black posteriorly. Rectrices under train gray, with dark and buff mottling on vanes lateral to rachis. Crus covered with buff feathers, marked with thin wavy dark barring.""Ocelli, or eyespots, on terminal portion of feathers of train are 40–50 mm long and 30–40 mm wide, have iridescent deep blue center patch, surrounded by roughly concentric areas of bluish green, then copper; barbs extending beyond ocellus are wirelike and not interlocking, and they form a squared-off end on the feather (DAJ).

Breeding males began 3–6 wk later, in late Jun to mid-Jul.

Sexes differ in plumage, primarily that of head. Female shows crown more or less obscured by bluish-gray and hindneck is black as in males. Dimorphism of crown plumage varies geographically (see Systematics: geographic variation), being less pronounced in southeastern populations, where crowns of definitive-plumaged females can be more-or-less black, matching formative-plumaged males but typically duller (less glossy) than those of definitive-plumaged males (Sheppard and Klimkiewicz 1976, Wood 1992c, Pyle 1997c). Females also show duller body plumage overall (Cadman et al. 1987, Pyle 1997c), especially upperparts (duller gray) and wing edging (dull and with brownish tinge). Males of all populations show crown and nape black glossy greenish black, and brighter body plumage overall, including upperparts (brighter bluish gray) and wing edging bluish gray without brownish tinge (Cadman et al. 1987, Pyle 1997c).",text,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19.1,12.2,4,4.2,18.5,88.6,27.6,60.9,31.2,48.8,21,Dunning,NA,NO,NA,NA,Forest,1,1,Omnivore,Omnivore,Insessorial,17.49,58.92,43.04,-102.26,8811748.35
