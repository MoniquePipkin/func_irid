Coots wintering in Alabama show a Nov–Dec peak in molt of head-, neck-, back-, rump-, scapular-, and breast feathers; second lesser peak of head and neck molt in Feb (Mcknight and Hepp 1999). It could not be determined whether latter Feb peak represented an extension of Prebasic molt, onset of Prealternate molt, or individual replacement of worn feathers. In any case, molt not confined to time period surrounding breeding season, as claimed by Gullion (Gullion 1953b), who indicated that coots undergo only 1 complete molt /yr. By either suspending or completing molt prior to period of lowest winter temperatures and reduced food availability (Jan), wintering coots probably reduce any additional nutrient or energetic costs associated with molt, so that total protein costs can be met by simply satisfying daily energy requirements (Mcknight and Hepp 1999).Head blackish mouse gray or blackish neutral gray on upper half, sometimes with faint-green or blue gloss.

The Definitive Basic plumage is mostly dark olive-brown, darkest on hindneck, interscapulars, and lower back, with bronzy or purplish iridescence on wings and especially the tail. The ends of the primaries are darker than the wing coverts and the tail feathers are even darker brown. The lores, malar region, chin, and upper throat are dull white and unmarked or faintly streaked with brown. Most feathers, except the primaries and rectrices, have a wide white streak along the shaft that comes to point at end of feather. The overlapping of the larger feathers creates bold, bright-white triangles on the back, scapulars, and especially the wing coverts. Toward the neck, the triangles become much narrower and appear as streaks, giving a whitish cast to the neck and head. The white triangles on the wing coverts can be helpful in the field in tentatively identifying the sex of adults. Probably because adult males generally are larger than females, their wing-covert triangles seem wider, longer, and more prominent than do those of females. Long triangles on 1 or 2 of the outermost (largest) greater coverts are usually visible on males but are hidden on females (Bryan 1996b).",,,,,"""Present primarily Oct-Sep in North American populations.

Suggests that Definitive Basic plumage follows Juvenile plumage and is acquired by a complete molt early in second year of life (about 14–16 mo). Primary molt proceeds outward from P1 (n = 10, Lee and Clark 1993). Molt progresses through at least a few primaries before secondary molt begins (Meyer and Collopy 1990). Tail molt begins with outermost (longest) rectrices when wing molt is well advanced (Meyer and Collopy 1990)."" Based on observations in mid-Jul and museum specimens, Lee and Clark (Lee and Clark 1993) concluded that total replacement of flight feathers was rapid, occurring in most kites from late Jun through Jul; all adults were in molt in mid-Jul and thus distinguishable from young of year. Observations at 27 nests (Meyer and Collopy 1990) and at large premigration communal roosts (Meyer 1993) indicated that individuals molted more slowly and that population was less synchronous than Lee and Clark (Lee and Clark 1993) suggested. Extra, nonbreeding birds began wing molt mid- to late Apr. Breeding females did not begin until late May–early Jun, when young were near fledging. Breeding males began 3–6 wk later, in late Jun to mid-Jul. In roosts, nearly 25% of adults had completed molt by 4 Aug, about 40% by 15 Aug, and 90% by 1 Sep; these birds could be distinguished from young of the year by latter's short tail."" Head, neck, underside, axillaries, and underwing coverts white.

Back, upperwing coverts, and all rectrices and remiges are black, no longer dull brown. White tips of flight feathers and upperwing coverts are gone (probably from wear even prior to molt). Scapulars and marginal and lesser upper-secondary coverts now have purplish rather than greenish iridescent sheen; remaining black areas on upperside appear to be dusted bluish gray in living birds (less so on distal portions of primaries and outer secondaries), possibly due to accumulated powder from powder feathers (Robertson 1988b). The mainly white posthumerals and white proximal portions of secondaries create mottled patterns on backs of perched birds.

Because Brewer's Blackbird undergoes a partial Prealternate I molt, a Definitive Prealternate molt also may occur. No information located on this molt. Plumage differs inappreciably from descriptions of male and female Alternate I feathering and coloration. Injection of theelin and thyroxin, hormones involved in manifestation of feminine plumage and iris coloration in many dimorphic species, resulted in no feminization of regenerating feathers or iris color in male Brewer's Blackbirds, suggesting that in this species a different mechanism is involved in development of male-female differences in these characters (Danforth and Price 1935).","""Medium-sized icterid with square-shaped tail and relatively short bill.

Suggests that Definitive Basic plumage follows Juvenile plumage and is acquired by a complete molt early in second year of life (about 14–16 mo). Primary molt proceeds outward from P1 (n = 10, Lee and Clark 1993). Molt progresses through at least a few primaries before secondary molt begins (Meyer and Collopy 1990). Tail molt begins with outermost (longest) rectrices when wing molt is well advanced (Meyer and Collopy 1990)."" Based on observations in mid-Jul and museum specimens, Lee and Clark (Lee and Clark 1993) concluded that total replacement of flight feathers was rapid, occurring in most kites from late Jun through Jul; all adults were in molt in mid-Jul and thus distinguishable from young of year. Observations at 27 nests (Meyer and Collopy 1990) and at large premigration communal roosts (Meyer 1993) indicated that individuals molted more slowly and that population was less synchronous than Lee and Clark (Lee and Clark 1993) suggested. Extra, nonbreeding birds began wing molt mid- to late Apr. Breeding females did not begin until late May–early Jun, when young were near fledging. Breeding males began 3–6 wk later, in late Jun to mid-Jul. In roosts, nearly 25% of adults had completed molt by 4 Aug, about 40% by 15 Aug, and 90% by 1 Sep; these birds could be distinguished from young of the year by latter's short tail."" Head, neck, underside, axillaries, and underwing coverts white. No longer streaked on head, neck, and chest due to tan shafts of contours, but a smaller number of shafts are now black (Lee and Clark 1993). Back, upperwing coverts, and all rectrices and remiges are black, no longer dull brown. White tips of flight feathers and upperwing coverts are gone (probably from wear even prior to molt). Scapulars and marginal and lesser upper-secondary coverts now have purplish rather than greenish iridescent sheen; remaining black areas on upperside appear to be dusted bluish gray in living birds (less so on distal portions of primaries and outer secondaries), possibly due to accumulated powder from powder feathers (Robertson 1988b). The mainly white posthumerals and white proximal portions of secondaries create mottled patterns on backs of perched birds. In adults, outermost rectrices (32–37 cm) are more than twice as long as innermost pair (Robertson 1988b).

Crown, including crest, dull blackish gray (N 4.04), crest with bluish iridescence when viewed from certain angles; forehead and crown with narrow white or pale blue streaks (1.9 PB 3.14/3.2); auriculars and nape dull blackish gray; mantle blackish gray (N 4.04); rump light sky blue (1.9 PB 8.2/3.2). Tail appears deep blue; outer webs of rectrices indigo blue (5.0 PB 3.14/3.0 and 7.6 PB 1.9/5.1); inner margins fuscous (5.0 YR 3.04/1.5) except central rectrices (r1) blue; all outer webs (and both webs of central pair of rectrices) barred blackish. Upperwing lesser coverts blackish gray (N 4.04); median, greater, and primary coverts broadly edged light blue (4.0 PB 5.9/10.4 and 3.2 PB 7.2/6.5), often with faint dusky bars on greater coverts. Primaries and secondaries fuscous (5.0 YR 3.04/1.5); outer margins of primaries light blue (4.0 PB 5.9/10.4 and 3.2 PB 7.2/6.5); outer margins of secondaries and tertials darker blue (smalt blue 7.0 PB 3.5/9.5 and ultramarine blue 7.3 PB 4.0/11.7); tertials conspicuously barred with black, bars becoming less distinct distally through secondaries.
